# Motor Imagery BCI

For the Motor Imagery BCI, the State-Of-The-Art model thats widely being used is the Common-Spatial-Pattern Algorithm. The original CSP algorithm is implemented with several variations for feature extraction.

> Make sure to check each code carefully. A fairly good machine learning process is developed for feature extraction, feature selection and classification process.

Available Algorithms:

1. [Common Spatial Pattern **(CSP)**](1.%20CSP/)
2. [Filter Bank CSP **(FBCSP)**](2.%20FBCSP/)
3. [**Multi-Class CSP**](3.%20MultiClass-CSP/)
4. [Common Spation-Spectral Pattern **(CSSP)**](4.%20CSSP/)
5. [Regularized Common Spatial Pattern **(RCSP)**](5.%20RCSP/)

To improve the **Temporal Resolution**, 3 famous **source localization filters** are implemented:

1. Common Average Reference **(CAR)**
2. **Low Laplacian**
3. **High Laplacian**

**Tested datasets:**

1. [BCI Competition IV](https://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/)
2. [BCI Competition IV a](https://www.bbci.de/competition/iii/desc_IVa.html)
3. [BCI Competition IV 2a](https://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/)
